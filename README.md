# reactive-json
Easily mutate JSON files via:

```javascript
import { ReactiveJSON } from 'reactive-json';
new ReactiveJSON({
  file: 'test.js'
}).mutate(
  (obj) => {
    console.log('original value is: ', obj.test);
    obj.test = 42; // modify
  }
);
```

The `mutate` method will automatically write the modified object back to the
specified `file`.
